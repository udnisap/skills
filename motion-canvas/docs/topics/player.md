# @motion-canvas/player

Custom element for playing Motion Canvas animations in the browser without the full editor.

Back to [index](index.md).

---

## Role

- **Playback**: Renders and plays the animation (same [core](core.md) + [2d](2d.md) runtime as the editor).
- **Controls**: Play/pause, time scrubbing, optionally playback speed.
- **Embedding**: Use the player when you want to show a finished (or exported) animation on a webpage, in a doc site, or in a custom app—without the timeline, inspector, or scene graph.

---

## When you use it

- Embedding a pre-rendered or live project in an HTML page.
- Building a custom viewer or kiosk.
- Delivering animations without the dev tooling.

For development and editing you use the [vite-plugin](vite-plugin.md) + [ui](ui.md) instead.
